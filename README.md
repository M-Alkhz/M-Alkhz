# Hi, I'm Michael

## Systems Programmer & Security Researcher
I focus on **low-level C++, Windows Internals, and Reverse Engineering**. I enjoy taking things apart to understand how they work under the hood—then finding ways to make them better.

### Technical Focus
* **Languages:** C++, Java, Python, x86/x64 Assembly
* **Systems:** Windows API, Manual Memory Management, Multi-threading & Concurrency
* **Tools:** x64dbg, Interactive Disassembler (IDA Pro), Ghidra

### Contributions
* **[ScyllaHide (x64dbg)](https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide):** * Identified and proposed a fix for a **signature-leak** within the `HookLibrary`.
  * Improved anti-anti-debugging stealth by stripping debug strings and RTTI artifacts from production builds.
